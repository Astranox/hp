This project is a loose attempt to replace the homepage at https://jabber.at.

It is not yet a finished project or anything.

### Ideas

What we definetly need:

#. blog posts
#. static pages
#. site-like framework (so we can show a different hostname depending on the URL)
#. i18n support (also for articles and pages)

More advanced features

#. accounts.jabber.at integration
#. test.jabber.at integration
#. comments on blog posts

Just a brain storming

#. some account settings integration (e.g. ability to configure MAM settings)
#. security stuff (e.g. from where you logged in recently, ...)
#. notifications/verifications of new logins (e.g. from new countries), maybe?
#. finally a webclient (shouldn't be to hard, there are js libs for it)
#. better social media integration (twitter cards, facebook opengraph tags)
#. calendar export of scheduled downtimes
