This project is a loose attempt to replace the homepage at https://jabber.at.

It is not yet a finished project or anything.

### Ideas

What we definetly need:

1. blog posts
2. static pages
3. site-like framework (so we can show a different hostname depending on the URL)
4. i18n support (also for articles and pages)

More advanced features

1. accounts.jabber.at integration
2. test.jabber.at integration
3. comments on blog posts

Just a brain storming

1. some account settings integration (e.g. ability to configure MAM settings)
2. security stuff (e.g. from where you logged in recently, ...)
3. notifications/verifications of new logins (e.g. from new countries), maybe?
4. finally a webclient (shouldn't be to hard, there are js libs for it)
5. better social media integration (twitter cards, facebook opengraph tags)
6. calendar export of scheduled downtimes

### TODOs

There are obviously still plenty of todos before the page can go live, without order:

1. Provide a contact page
2. Support umlauts in URLs
3. German URLs don't work in an English browser and vice versa.
4. Tags for blog posts
5. Importer for data from account.jabber.at
6. Internationalized URLs for URL paths (`/contact/` vs. `/kontakt/`)
7. Provide a webchat
8. Minimized JavaScript/CSS
9. Import Tags from Drupal
10. Automatically convert at least some links from imported Drupal data
11. Add the ability to edit your email address
12. RSS feed
13. Search functionality
